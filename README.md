# HOWLR
### A website that helps freshers and small startups connect with each other to hire the right talent. This website was developed in less than 24hrs in a hackathon conducted by RNSIT called Hack Overflow.
## Prerequisite
### XAMPP (Installs Apache serevr, MariaDB(MySQL) and PHP which we will need.)
## Installation

### 1) Clone the repo
``` bash
 git clone https://github.com/Cr4zySh4rk/HOWLRPublic.git
```
### 2) Copy the repo to htdocs

### 3) Open phpMyAdmin after starting the serevrs from XAMPP Console

### 4) Create a database called howlr2

### 5) Import the addDatabase.sql file into the database

### 6) finally edit index.php in htdocs like below so that the website is run on localhost during server startup
