### 2) Copy the repo to htdocs

### 3) Open phpMyAdmin after starting the serevrs from XAMPP Console

### 4) Create a database called howlr2

### 5) Import the addDatabase.sql file into the database

### 6) finally edit index.php in htdocs like below so that the website is run on localhost during server startup
